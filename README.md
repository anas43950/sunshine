# Sunshine
App is already in working stage, but the API key is deactivated so you'll have to add your own key. 
<br>
<br>
It's very simple to get the key, just create a free account on [OpenWeatherMap](https://openweathermap.org/) and get your key.
<br>
Paste it in _com/technowapps/sunshine/utilities/Constants.java_
